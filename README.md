# Machine Learning Approach for Employee Performance Prediction

This project uses machine learning (XGBoost) to predict employee productivity based on operational and HR metrics. It includes model building, evaluation, deployment using Gradio, and documentation.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Google Colab
- Gradio (UI)
- GitHub (Version control)

## 📂 Contents
- 📘 Employee_Performance_Prediction.ipynb – Main ML notebook
- 🧠 gwp.pkl – Saved XGBoost model
- 📁 docs/ – 10 project documentation files
- 📸 screenshots/ – Output screenshots
- 🎥 video/ – Demo video



## 🧠 Final Model
XGBoost – R² = 0.83 | F1-Score = 0.86
